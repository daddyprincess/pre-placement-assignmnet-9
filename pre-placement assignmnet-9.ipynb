    "\n",
    "1.Output Layer: In regression tasks, the output layer of the neural network typically consists of a single \n",
    " neuron, which outputs a continuous value representing the predicted regression target. The activation\n",
    "function used in the output neuron depends on the nature of the regression problem. For example, for\n",

    "tasks, activation functions such as sigmoid or tanh can be employed to restrict the output within a specific\n",

    "RMSprop. The model parameters, including weights and biases, are updated iteratively based on the gradient of\n",

    "\n",
    "1.Adversarial Training: This approach involves augmenting the training process with adversarial examples. \n",
    " During training, the model is exposed to adversarial samples, which helps it to learn and adapt to defend\n",

    "\n",
    "2.Defensive Distillation: Defensive distillation is a technique where a model is trained to mimic the\n",
    " behavior of another model, called the teacher model. The teacher model is trained on the original dataset,\n",

    "\n",
    "1.Overfitting: When a model becomes overly complex, it can start to memorize the training data instead of \n",

    "Scaling neural network training on distributed systems involves distributing the computational workload \n",
    "across multiple machines or nodes. This approach allows for faster training and handling larger datasets.\n",
    "However, there are several considerations and challenges to address when scaling neural network training on\n",
    "distributed systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Communication overhead: Distributed training requires communication between nodes to synchronize model \n",
    " updates and exchange gradients. The communication overhead can become a bottleneck when scaling to a large\n",
    "number of nodes. Techniques like gradient compression, asynchronous training, and efficient communication\n",
    "protocols can help mitigate this challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Data parallelism vs. model parallelism: Distributed training can be performed using either data parallelism\n",
    " or model parallelism. In data parallelism, each node processes a subset of the training data and shares the\n",
    "gradients with other nodes. In model parallelism, different parts of the model are processed on different\n",
    "nodes. Choosing the appropriate parallelism strategy depends on factors like model architecture, available\n",
    "memory, and communication overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Synchronization and convergence: Ensuring model convergence during distributed training can be challenging \n",
    " due to the asynchronous nature of the updates. Techniques like synchronous updates with global \n",
    "synchronization, parameter server architectures, or using advanced optimization algorithms like AdamW or\n",
    "LAMB can help address convergence issues.\n",

    "ensure the robustness of the training process. Techniques like redundant computation and distributed storage\n",
    "systems can help mitigate the impact of failures.\n",

    "6.Scalability and resource management: Scaling the training process to a large number of nodes requires\n",
    " efficient resource management. Allocating and distributing computational resources, memory, and storage\n",
    "effectively becomes crucial. Tools and frameworks like Kubernetes, Apache Spark, and TensorFlow's \n",
    "distributed training API provide support for resource management and scaling.\n",

    "large neural networks or when working with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Generalization: The batch size can affect the generalization performance of the model. Smaller batch sizes\n",
